<h5>The trivia game is based on jQuery and manipulation of the DOM.

When the game starts, each question that appears on the screen is timed at 30 seconds, and questions must be answered within that duration. Scores are tallied accordingly as the user has answered.
At the end of the game, the score is revealed to the player and the game is reset.</h5>
